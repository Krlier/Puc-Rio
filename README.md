# Puc-Rio

My projects for Computer Engineering classes. Each folder is named after the disciple's code, with it's full name available in the [README] file. <img src="Images/githubparrot.gif" width="35" height="35"/>

## Eng1000 - Introduction to Engineering ðŸ““

The main goal of this project was to create a [PID controller] using [Arduino]. In my case, I created a program to handle temperature changes by increasing and decreasing the voltage on a computer fan in order to cool a house prototype.

## Inf1018 - Basic Software ðŸ““

* [T1][1] - [converte_utf.c][3] is a program in C to convert UTF-8 files into UTF-16 and back, UTF-16 into UTF-8.
* [T2][2] - [Compila.c][4] is a program in C to compile a simple made up programming language

## Inf1019 - Computer Systems ðŸ““

* [T1][5] - Routine in C to simulate how a processor handles different incoming processes.
* [T2][6] - Routine in C made to simulate a page table.

## Inf1301 - Modular Programming ðŸ““
In this class my group and I were tasked with creating a Freecell game.
